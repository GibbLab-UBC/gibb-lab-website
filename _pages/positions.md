### Join the Gibb Lab: Where Cancer Biology Meets Cutting-Edge Data Science

We're always on the lookout for curious minds and driven individuals who want to make a real impact in cancer research. Whether your interests lie in spatial transcriptomics, machine learning, digital pathology, or translational oncology, we believe great science happens when talented people come together.


If you're a prospective grad student or postdoc interested in tumor heterogeneity, bioinformatics, or clinical impact, weâ€™d love to hear from you. Even if we don't have a formal posting live, we're happy to chat about potential opportunities.
Interested?


Reach out by email to discuss how you could be part of our collaborative, interdisciplinary team.
