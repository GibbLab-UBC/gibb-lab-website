### About the Lab

The Gibb Lab based at the Vancouver Prostate Centre, is a translational research program that leverages genomic and bioinformatic approaches to investigate bladder and prostate cancer. The lab's overarching goal is to develop innovative prognostic and predictive biomarkers to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment outcomes. A primary lab focus is on evaluating bladder tumor heterogeneity to enhance our understanding of bladder cancer biology and its clinical behavior, including the mechanisms underlying treatment resistance. While the lab primarily emphasizes transcriptome-based approaches, it also integrates DNA-based and imaging technologies. This work involves close collaboration with a global network of clinicians and scientists from Canada, the United States, and beyond.
