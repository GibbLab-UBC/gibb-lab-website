      <hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #444; margin: 10px 0;">
      <p>
        NMIBC makes up about 75% of new bladder cancer diagnoses, most commonly as low-grade, stage Ta tumors (TaLG).
        While these cases often have excellent outcomes, certain patients – particularly those with recurrent, multifocal,
        or large tumors – face a significantly higher risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC),
        which requires more aggressive treatment and carries a poorer prognosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Current clinical tools can't reliably identify which TaLG patients are truly at risk.
        There's a clear need for better risk stratification to personalize management and improve outcomes.
      </p>
      <p><strong>We aim to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Validate promising molecular classifiers in large, well-annotated TaLG cohorts</li>
        <li>Investigate the biology and clinical relevance of high-grade Ta (TaHG) and T1 disease</li>
        <li>Expand classifier frameworks to support prospective clinical testing and decision-making</li>

      <hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #444; margin: 10px 0;">
      <p>
        Accurately staging bladder cancer before surgery remains a major challenge. In patients with presumed organ-confined disease—
        including high-grade T1 (HGT1) or T2 tumors—up to 40% are found to have more advanced disease (pT3+ and/or N+) at the time
        of radical cystectomy if they don't receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Molecular subtyping offers promise, but current tools still lack the precision needed to reliably identify high-risk patients.
        This gap affects our ability to guide treatment decisions and avoid under- or overtreatment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>This project seeks to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use transcriptome-based approaches to define the biology of aggressive bladder cancer</li>
        <li>Develop molecular classifiers that improve risk stratification and guide treatment</li>
        <li>Explore pathology-based AI models to predict upstaging with greater accuracy</li>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Molecular Evolution Following Neoadjuvant Therapy</h3>
      <hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #444; margin: 10px 0;">
      <p>
        Despite standard treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy, outcomes in muscle-invasive
        bladder cancer (MIBC) remain poor, with 5-year overall survival rates hovering around 55%. Complete pathological response (ypT0)
        is achieved in only ~30% of patients, and those with residual MIBC often require adjuvant therapy—extending treatment timelines
        and complicating care decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent molecular profiling of post-treatment tumors, including those exposed to NAC, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab,
        has revealed distinct residual subtypes. Among these is a "scar-like" molecular profile, bearing similarities to the
        previously described p53-like subtype. Both exhibit gene expression patterns associated with wound healing, suggesting
        fibroblast infiltration, tumor cell remodeling, or both.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Our study will:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Validate a transcriptome-based classifier to identify scar-like tumors following systemic therapy</li>
        <li>Define the cellular composition and spatial organization of these tumors</li>
        <li>Clarify how scar-like profiles arise and whether they can be therapeutically induced as part of a favorable treatment response</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #444; margin: 10px 0;">
      <p>
        Grade Group 2 (GG2) prostate cancer (PCa) presents a clinical dilemma: some men can be safely managed with active surveillance (AS),
        while others harbor aggressive disease requiring intervention. Current clinical tools lack the precision to distinguish these patients,
        leading to both overtreatment and undertreatment. There is a critical need for biomarkers to improve risk stratification and guide
        clinical decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this gap, we are investigating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and digital pathology features as novel biomarkers
        in GG2 prostate cancer. Preliminary data suggest the existence of distinct molecular subtypes with prognostic relevance,
        and advances in AI-based image analysis offer new opportunities to extract predictive features from routine biopsy slides.
        By combining molecular and morphological data, we aim to improve risk prediction and support more personalized treatment decisions.
      </p>
      <p><strong>We aim to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define molecular subtypes of GG2 tumors linked to adverse outcomes</li>
        <li>Develop and validate a transcriptome-based risk classifier</li>
        <li>Integrate spatial and image-based features to enhance prediction</li>
      </ul>
